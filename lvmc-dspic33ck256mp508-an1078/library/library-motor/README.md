# Motor Control Library for dsPIC33 DSCs
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The Motor Control Library is a collection of functions that you can use as building blocks for implementing Field Oriented Control (FOC) of 3-phase motor control applications on dsPICÂ® Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs).</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The Motor Control Library is architected to enable a user application to call time-critical control loop functions in it and take advantage of the motor control peripherals available on the dsPIC33 DSCs to implement a design.</p>
